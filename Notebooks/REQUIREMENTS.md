# Project Requirements

## üìã Original Requirements

### Initial Concept
Create an interactive visualization tool for understanding transformer self-attention mechanisms.

### Core Functional Requirements
1. **Text Input**: Accept user sentences for processing
2. **Tokenization**: Break text into tokens (words)
3. **Attention Visualization**: Show attention matrices
4. **Multi-Head Support**: Visualize multiple attention heads
5. **Settings Control**: Causal mask and positional encoding toggles
6. **Step Navigation**: Walk through the transformer pipeline

## üîÑ Evolved Requirements (Based on User Feedback)

### Critical User Feedback
*"As a beginner, when I first look at this page, I have no idea what to do with it."*

This led to fundamental requirement changes:

### New Educational Requirements

#### 1. Progressive Learning Experience
- **Guided Introduction**: Welcome flow explaining purpose
- **Step-by-Step Revelation**: Show one concept at a time
- **Forced Progression**: Require understanding before advancement
- **Clear Instructions**: Explain what to do at each step

#### 2. Context and Explanation
- **Why Before What**: Explain purpose before showing features
- **Multiple Explanation Levels**: Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced
- **Rich Analogies**: Real-world metaphors for abstract concepts
- **Immediate Feedback**: Respond to all user interactions

#### 3. Interactive Learning
- **Hands-On Requirements**: Force interaction to proceed
- **Understanding Checks**: Quizzes and validation gates
- **Experimental Learning**: "What if" scenarios
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual journey indicators
